Install Debian with user "vdiuser" , add a network mirror and ensure you unselect GNOME and select LXDE and SSH server
once you are done installing, you will need to log in at root and run

sudo usermod -aG sudo vdiuser

nano /etc/apt/source.list
    Comment out any "CDROM"

apt install git

run ip a (to get your machines IP)

ssh into the machine as vdiuser (ssh vdiuser@<ip>) and run

git clone https://github.com/JacksonBaer/debianvdi.git && cd debianvdi/ && chmod +x simple_setup.sh
